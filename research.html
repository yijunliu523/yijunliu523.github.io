                        We address the challenge of inclusivity in collaborative online websites, focusing on improving them for diverse groups in terms of power dynamics, cultural differences, and social awkwardness. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the enhancement of inclusivity in collaborative websites. Our methodology involves LLM-generated ideas for inclusive features, their implementation, and refinement based on user feedback. We hope this project can propose a new way to web design, prototyping, and development with inclusivity.

                        Affecting over 6 million people in the U.S., atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is a major public health concern. Many AF patients seek out atrial fibrillation ablation (AFA) to improve quality of life and decrease symptomatic AF episodes. AFA, cauterization of areas of the left atrium, is the most effective treatment to decrease symptomatic episodes of paroxysmal or persistent AF. <br/><br/>
                        AFA success rates vary based on type of AF and other clinical variables, but many patients will not be AF-free following AFA. At leading AFA centers, AF-free rates at one and two years after de novo  AFA were 40% and 37%, respectively. Given the modest success rates of AFA, patient selection for this procedure should receive more attention. Sociodemographic and clinical phenotype data have been used to predict AFA response, but collectively they have poor predictive ability. <br/><br/>
                        The widespread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems presents a ripe opportunity for a paradigm shift for predicting AFA outcomes. A better understanding of patient specific factors predicting AFA outcome will inform patient selection for this procedure. In this study, we propose to use EHR data and machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for outcomes of primary AFA procedures. We will also characterize outcomes by subgroups s as well as examine differences in AFA outcomes by sex analysis.

                        Capture The Flag competitions and games have been employed in cybersecurity in addition to formal education. The goal of this study is to examine students’ browsing activities in completing CTF challenges. To achieve the goal, we developed a student observatory that allows us to monitor their activities. We can use students’ browsing activities to understand students’ learning process for CTF challenges while completing them and, therefore, bring insights into Computer Security education. The student observatory developed in the study is a Chrome Extension, CTF browsing monitor, that collects the URLs visited, the percentages of webpages viewed by participants, and the time stamps on each visit. There will also be a short survey containing three questions about the webpage just viewed for non-search engine URLs to further gain participants’ perspectives on the webpage they just view.

                <p class="item_date">August 2021</p>

                        Mobile crowd sensing (MCS) is a promising sensing paradigm that effectively gathers and evaluates data collected from the real world. 
                        With a large number of users and tasks, one of the fundamental problems is how to allocate these tasks to each user with the consideration of distance traveled by all users, maximum distance traveled by each user, the number of total users recruited, and time sensitivity for each task. Thus, this study investigates the task allocation in task-abundant MCS. In particular, there are two scenarios studied: one-to-one mapping (each user can only fulfill one task) and one-to multiple mapping (each user can fulfill multiple tasks) between users and tasks.
                        This research uses real-world data from the D4D dataset, containing 50,000 users’ phone call records and cell phone tower locations. The algorithms used to match tasks to users are bipartite matching through repeated augmenting paths and maximum flow (one-to-one mapping) and greedy algorithms (one-to-multiple mapping). The results show that 1. bipartite matching algorithms (one-to-one) present lower task completeness rates but better (smaller) distance/user value; 2. there is a trade-off existing between distance traveled and user participation in one-to-multiple mapping; 3. selecting the minimum distance algorithm may lead to smaller loss compared to the minimum user algorithm, given the same weighting for 1 km traveled and one user recruited.

                        Oil spillage has caused serious environmental issues around the world. 
                        Therefore, interests in hydrophobic material have raised among scientists to separate oil/water as it can only allow oil to pass through but not water. 
                        An interest has been drawn to a stainless-steel wire net supported FAU zeolite membrane for oil/water separation. However, FAU zeolite membrane is a hydrophilic material. In order to change FAU zeolite membrane from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, post-synthesis may be a feasible solution. 
                        Perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (POTS) is a chemical compound that is largely used to modify the surface of a material to gain a hydrophobic property, thus it may be able to modify the FAU zeolite membrane through post-synthesis to achieve a hydrophobic property without changing FAU crystalline structure.
                        The hydrophobic property can therefore allow FAU membrane to separate oil/water, hopefully remains the advantages of FAU membrane and stainless-steel wire net.
