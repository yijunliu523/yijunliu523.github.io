		<p>
			Group: Amanda Chu, Siyan Pu, Kunal Suri, and Yijun Liu<br>
			The dataset we decided to use to tackle the assignment was New York City Transit Authorityâ€™s dataset called <a href="https://github.com/aboskovic21/LostFound" target="_blank"><i>Things lost (and not yet found) on the New York subway</i></a>. The dataset has various categories, such as clothing, electronics, and medical equipment, and every row represents a date. It keeps track of how many total items are lost based on their category and what the daily change is for over a year in 2014/2015. Interestingly, enough, one of those phones in the dataset is probably mine.
