                        This website aims to alleviate that gap by providing a compiled source of data on past graduate program applications across the country. Particularly, it provides a forum where data typically scattered across Reddit and other such platforms can be organized and presented in a neat, easily accessible manner. Undergraduate users will be able to search amongst profiles of current or past graduate students to see their portfolios and the types of research and activities successful applications include. They will be able to search by both the target university and program. They will also be able to access information such as demographics, statement of purpose, and CV. Users who have already applied to graduate school will be able to use the website to upload their portfolio. They will be able to edit their existing data and also create a profile page with contact details and other general information.

                        In an age of information, it can be difficult to distinguish fact from myth. Women’s health in particular suffers from rampant misinformation due to a lack of education in schools and the stigma surrounding discussing women’s bodies. We created a Women’s Health Bot via Flow XO that educates on different aspects of women’s health issues by asking the user to take a 10-question quiz, therefore clarifying any misconceptions and prompting the user to evaluate their own assumptions about Women’s Health.

                        The dataset we decided to use to conduct data visualization was New York City Transit Authority’s dataset called Things lost (and not yet found) on the New York subway. The dataset has various categories, such as clothing, electronics, and medical equipment, and every row represents a date. It keeps track of how many total items are lost based on their category and what the daily change is for over a year in 2014/2015. Interestingly, enough, one of those phones in the dataset is probably mine. 
                        By utilizing Tableau and JavaScript, our group has produced a website containing the three diagrams for analysis and one sophisticated persuasion technique for the dataset.                    </p>

                        Elm City Stories is an educational game that aims to identify teenagers who may need help in the future based on their performance in the game. This data analysis evaluates the game’s ability to understand and predict potential drug usage by correlating participants’ performance in the drug-related aspects of the game with their S5 survey result, which indicates their ability to resist drugs in the real world. We realized the “Dunning-Kruger Effect” and the “Imposter Syndrome” might play a role in the correlation study, and the S5 survey might have reliability issues.
